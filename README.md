### How to play
The first player to get 50 points wins.
If you roll one you lose all your points and the game switches to the next player.
When a player presses hold you add the current score to the toal score and the game switches to the next player. 
The goal is to reach 50 points and avoid rolling one. ^_^

### Project Description
Pig game is one of the first web games I developed. The game was developed during my self paced **Javascript and Web development** course on Udemy. This game tested my patience and knowledge equally. It required a lot of DOM manipulation and Javascript knowledge. In my opinion, developing games is a very challenging task. As a game developer you need to think of all possible scenarios and outcomes. As a result, the more complex the game gets logically and graphically advanced, the more challenging the game testing can be.

### Future Improvement
- Re-develop the game using ReactJs for faster rendering and sustainability
